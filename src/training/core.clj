(ns training.core)

;;Intro
;;=====

;;This will be our initial namespace for
;;working with clojure, exploring its
;;libraries, and eventually using
;;clojure to hack on MARATHON.

;;This namespace will help us document
;;various demos and exercises we have
;;setup for the on-site training.

;;As such, there isn't much content
;;here beyond our comments.

;;As you progress through the training,
;;feel free to take notes here, or use
;;it as a scratch pad.

;;If you haven't figured it out yet,
;;comments are delimited by one or more ';'
