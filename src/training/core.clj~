;;Intro
;;=====

;;This will be our initial namespace for
;;working with clojure, exploring its
;;libraries, and eventually using
;;clojure to hack on MARATHON.

;;This namespace will help us document
;;various demos and exercises we have
;;setup for the on-site training.

;;As such, there isn't much content
;;here beyond our comments.
