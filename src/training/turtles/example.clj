;;Turtles Redux
;;=============
;;There are a few commands our turtle now knows.
;;It can look-at an [x y] coordinate.
;;It can trace-path a sequence of [x y] coordinates.

;;Do these new commands, combined with a newfound knowledge
;;of clojure's sequence operations and math functions help?


;;If so, try the following:

;;Generate a sequence of points that outlines a triangle
(defn tri [])

;;Define a function that scales any sequence of points by
;;a scale-x and a scale-y factor.
(defn scale [scale-x scale-y pts])
  

;;define a function that translates any sequence of points
;;by a tx and a ty amount
(defn translate [tx ty pts])
  

;;Make the turtle draw any triangle, centered at
;;the point [-100 -100], with an identical triangle
;;outside of it.  Try to use the preceding functions
;;to transform the points that describe the triangle.

;;Since our turtle knows how to follow points,
;;trying reading points from the
;;file "points.txt" and trace the result.
